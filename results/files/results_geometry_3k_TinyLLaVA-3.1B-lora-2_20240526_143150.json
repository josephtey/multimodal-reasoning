The diagram shows the length of the arch as 15 units. The question asks for the area of the shaded region.\n\nTo solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Shape of the Arch**: The arch is divided into three sections by two smaller arches. This suggests that the shape of the arch is a combination of a circle and two smaller circles.\n\n2. **Calculate the Area of the Arch**: The area of the arch can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle: \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\). The radius of the arch is half of the total length, which is 15/2 = 7.5 units. Therefore, the area of the arch is \\( A = \\pi \\times (7.5)^2 \\approx 176.71 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of the Smaller Arches**: The area of each smaller arch is half the area of the larger arch. Therefore, the area of each smaller arch is \\( \\frac{176.71}{2} \\approx 88.36 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Area of the Shaded Region**: The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the three smaller arches. Since there are two smaller arches, the total area is \\( 2 \\times 88.36 \\approx 176.72 \\).\n\n5. **Compare with the Given Choices**: The calculated area of the shaded region is 176.72.

The question asks for the measure of angle 5.\n\nTo find the measure of angle 5, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles around a point (in this case, the center of the circle) is 360\u00b0. \n\n1. Identify the known angles:\n   - Angle 110\u00b0\n   - Angle 150\u00b0\n\n2. Calculate the sum of the known angles:\n   - 110\u00b0 + 150\u00b0 = 260\u00b0\n\n3. Subtract the sum of the known angles from 360\u00b0 to find the measure of angle 5:\n   - 360\u00b0 - 260\u00b0 = 100\u00b0\n\n4. Since angle 5 is the remaining angle in the circle, it must be equal to 100\u00b0.\n\n5. Compare the calculated value with the given choices:\n   - 100\u00b0 matches choice D.\n\nTherefore, the measure of angle 5 is 150\u00b0. However, this seems to be a mistake in the diagram or the question. The correct measure of angle 5 should be 100\u00b0.\n\nAnswer: D",

The length of the rectangle is 15 mm, and the angle between the diagonal and one of the sides is 30\u00b0. The diagram also includes a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 15 mm and a base of 15 mm.\n\nTo find the area of the figure, we need to calculate the area of the rectangle and the area of the right triangle separately, then add them together.\n\n1. Area of the rectangle:\n   - Length = 15 mm\n   - Width = 15 mm (since it's a square)\n   - Area of the rectangle = Length \u00d7 Width = 15 mm \u00d7 15 mm = 225 mm\u00b2\n\n2.

The triangle is divided into two smaller triangles by a diagonal line. The diagram indicates that the smaller triangles are similar to the larger triangle.\n\nTo find the value of x, we can use the similarity of the triangles. The ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles is equal.

The chord FG is marked with a red line. The circle is divided into two triangles by the chord FG. The angle at G is marked as x\u00b0. The diagram also includes a right triangle with a hypotenuse marked as x.\n\nTo find x, we can use the properties of the circle and the given angles. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the relationship between the angles and the chords:**\n   - The angle at F (70\u00b0) is an inscribed angle, meaning it subtends an arc of the circle.\n   - The chord FG is a diameter, so the angle at G (x\u00b0) is half of the central angle subtended by the chord.\n\n2. **Use the inscribed angle theorem:**\n   - The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.\n   - Therefore, x\u00b0 = (1/2) * 70\u00b0 = 35\u00b0.\n\n3. **Verify the relationship between the angles and the chords:**\n   - The angle at G (x\u00b0) is half of the central angle subtended by the chord FG.\n   - The central angle subtended by the chord FG is twice the inscribed angle at F.\n   - Therefore, x\u00b0 = (1/2) * (2 * 70\u00b0) = 70\u00b0.\n\n4. **Confirm the correct angle:**\n   - The angle at G is marked as x\u00b0, which is indeed half of the central angle subtended by the chord FG.\n\n5. **Select the correct answer:**\n   - The correct answer is C. 70\u00b0.\n\n**Answer: C**",
