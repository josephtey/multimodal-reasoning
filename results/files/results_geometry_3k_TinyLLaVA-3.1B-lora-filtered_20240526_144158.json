In this case, \\( P \\) is the centroid of \\(\\triangle X Y Z \\).\n\n2. **Use the centroid-median theorem:** The centroid divides each median into two segments, with the segment from the vertex to the centroid being twice as long as the segment from the centroid to the opposite side.\n\n3. **Determine the length of \\( P K \\):** Given \\( P K = 3 \\), this is the length of the median from vertex \\( K \\) to the centroid \\( P \\).\n\n4. **Apply the centroid-median theorem:** Since \\( P K \\) is the median from vertex \\( K \\) to the centroid \\( P \\), the segment from \\( K \\) to the centroid \\( P \\) is twice as long as the segment from the centroid to the opposite side.\n\n5. **Calculate the length of \\( Y J \\):** Since \\( X J = 8 \\), the segment from \\( X \\) to the centroid \\( P \\) is half the length of the segment from the centroid to the opposite side.

In a kite, the diagonals intersect at right angles, and the angles formed by the diagonals are equal.\n\n1. **Identify the Diagonals:**\n   - Diagonal FG intersects diagonals GH and JH at right angles.\n   - Diagonal GH intersects diagonals FJ and JH at right angles.\n\n2. **Use the Right Angle Property:**\n   - Since the diagonals intersect at right angles, angles FGH and GHJ are 90\u00b0 each.\n\n3. **Use the Equal Angles Property:**\n   - Since the diagonals intersect at right angles, angles FGH and GHJ are equal.\n\n4. **Calculate Angle GFG:**\n   - Since angles FGH and GHJ are both 90\u00b0, angle GFG is the sum of these two angles.\n   - Therefore, angle GFG = 90\u00b0 + 90\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.\n\n5. **Verify the Answer:**\n   - The measure of angle GFG is 180\u00b0, which corresponds to choice D.\n\nAnswer: D",
