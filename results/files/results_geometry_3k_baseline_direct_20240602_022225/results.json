The angle formed by these lines is labeled as \"A B C\". The diagram also includes a measure of the angle, which is \"33\u00b0\". \n\nTo find the measure of the angle \"A B C\", we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180\u00b0. Since we know that one of the angles is \"33\u00b0\", we can subtract this from 180\u00b0 to find the measure of the other two angles. \n\n180\u00b0 - 33\u00b0 = 147\u00b0\n\nSince the triangle is formed by the intersection of two lines, the other two angles must be equal. Therefore, each of the other two angles is also \"33\u00b0\". \n\nSo, the measure of the angle \"A B C\" is \"33\u00b0\".",
