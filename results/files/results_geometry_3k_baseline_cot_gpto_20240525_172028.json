    "predicted_answer": "The triangle with the \\(45^\\circ\\) angle and leg of length 8 is a 45-45-90 triangle. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are congruent and the hypotenuse is equal to the leg length times \\(\\sqrt{2}\\):\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the length of the leg. Then, in a 45-45-90 triangle:\n\\[ x = 8 \\]\nThus, the hypotenuse \\(y\\) is:\n\\[ y = 8 \\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nThe small triangle with angles \\(30^\\circ-60^\\circ-90^\\circ\\) has a known ratio of sides: 1 to \\(\\sqrt{3}\\) to 2. Since the side opposite \\(30^\\circ\\) corresponds to a half of the hypotenuse of the \\(45^\\circ-45^\\circ-90^\\circ\\) hypotenuse:\n\\[ x = \\frac{y}{2} = \\frac{8 \\sqrt{2}}{2} = 4\\sqrt{2} \\]\n\nTherefore, the correct option is: B. 4 \\sqrt { 2 }",
