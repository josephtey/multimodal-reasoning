Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, we have \\( \\angle RST = \\angle ABC \\).\n2.

The diagram also includes a variable y.\n\nTo find the value of x, we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles on a straight line is 180 degrees. Since the lines are parallel, the angles formed by the intersecting lines are equal.\n\nLet's denote the angle on the left as a. We have:\n\na + x = 180 \n\nSince the angle on the right is 55 degrees, we have:\n\nx + 55 = 180 \n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 180 - 55 \n\nx = 125 \n\nThe answer is the value of x.\n\nAnswer: C",
