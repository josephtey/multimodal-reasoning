Let y be the length of the segment from O to the point where the chord intersects the circle [[var y]].\n5. Since CD is a diameter of the circle, the length of CD is twice the radius. Therefore, we have [[eq d = 2r]].\n6. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have [[eq x^2 + y^2 = d^2]].\n7. Substituting the values, we get [[eq x^2 + y^2 = (2r)^2]].\n8.
