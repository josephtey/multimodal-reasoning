So, we have:\n\nRS^2 = 2^2 + PQ^2\n\nNext, we need to find the length of the line segment PQ. We can do this by using the fact that the angle between the radius and the line segment is 120 degrees. This means that the length of the line segment PQ is equal to the radius times the sine of 120 degrees. So, we have:\n\nPQ = 2 \\* sin(120)\n\nNow, we can substitute this value of PQ into the equation for RS^2:\n\nRS^2 = 2^2 + (2 \\* sin(120))^2\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\nRS^2 = 4 + (4 \\* sin^2(120))\n\nSince sin^2(120) is equal to 1 - cos^2(120), we can substitute this value into the equation:\n\nRS^2 = 4 + (4 - 1)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\nRS^2 = 5\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find that RS is approximately equal to:\n\nRS \\approx \\sqrt{5}\n\nFinally, we can find the length of the line segment RS by multiplying the radius by the square root of 5:\n\nRS \\approx 2 \\* \\sqrt{5}\n\nRounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:\n\nRS \\approx 2.24 inches\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. 2.27 inches.",

Since we know that angle A is 20 degrees, we can subtract this from 180 to find the measure of the other two angles.    180 - 20 = 160.    Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find the measure of angle D.    Since we know that angle D is 9 degrees, we can subtract this from 160 to find the measure of the other two angles.    160 - 9 = 151.    Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find the measure of angle C.    Since we know that angle C is 40 degrees, we can subtract this from 151 to find the measure of the other two angles.    151 - 40 = 111.    Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find the measure of angle B.    Since we know that angle B is 6 degrees, we can subtract this from 111 to find the measure of the other two angles.    111 - 6 = 105.    Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find the measure of angle A.    Since we know that angle A is 20 degrees, we can subtract this from 105 to find the measure of the other two angles.    105 - 20 = 85.    Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find the measure of angle D.

The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is 20 cm, and the other two sides are 12 cm and x cm. So, we have the equation: 20^2 = 12^2 + x^2.

The triangle is also isosceles, meaning it has two sides of equal length.    Since the triangle is isosceles, the two equal sides must be the same length.    We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the third side.    The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.    In this case, the hypotenuse is the unknown side, W, and the other two sides are 8 and 10.    So, we have W^2 = 8^2 + 10^2.

So, the third angle is 180\u00b0 - 60\u00b0 - 20\u00b0 = 100\u00b0.    Since the triangle is isosceles, the two angles on the left are equal.    Let's call them x.    So, we have x + x + 100\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.    Simplifying, we get 2x + 100\u00b0 = 180\u00b0.    Subtracting 100\u00b0 from both sides, we get 2x = 80\u00b0.

Now, we can find the value of y by substituting x = 3 into the equation y = 3x - 7. This gives us y = 3(3) - 7 = 6 - 7 = -1. Now, we can find the value of z by substituting x = 3 and y = -1 into the equation z = x + y. This gives us z = 3 + (-1) = 2. Finally, we can find the value of m by substituting x = 3, y = -1, and z = 2 into the equation m = x + y + z. This gives us m = 3 + (-1) + 2 = 4. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 152.",

This means that m is the line that divides X Z into two equal parts and is perpendicular to both X and Z.    \n\nNext, we are given that W X = 7.45. This means that the length of the line segment W X is 7.45 units.    \n\nNow, we need to find the length of the line segment X Z. We can use the fact that W X = 7.45 and W Z = 14.9 to find X Z.    \n\nSince m is the perpendicular bisector of X Z, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find X Z. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.    \n\nIn this case, we have a right triangle with sides X Z and W Z, and the length of the hypotenuse is m.    \n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we can write the equation:    \n\nX Z^2 + W Z^2 = m^2    \n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:    \n\nX Z^2 + 14.9^2 = m^2    \n\nSince we know that W X = 7.45, we can also write the equation:    \n\nX Z = W X + W Z    \n\nSubstituting the values we know, we get:    \n\nX Z = 7.45 + 14.9    \n\nX Z = 22.4    \n\nNow, we can substitute the value of X Z into the equation we derived earlier:    \n\n22.4^2 + 14.9^2 = m^2    \n\n527.84 + 214.81 = m^2    \n\n843.65 = m^2    \n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:    \n\nm = \u221a843.65    \n\nm \u2248 29.8    \n\nTherefore, the length of the line segment X Z is approximately 29.8 units.    \n\nFinally, we can find W X by subtracting the length of X Z from the length of W Z:    \n\nW X = W Z - X",

To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.    Since we have one angle, we can find the other two angles by subtracting the known angle from 180 degrees.    Let's assume the angle opposite the side of length 3 in is A, and the angle opposite the side of length 4y - 5 in is B.    Then, we have:\n\n                  A + B + C = 180 degrees\n\n                  Since we know the length of one side (3 in) and the length of one angle (A), we can find the length of the other side (2x) and the length of the other angle (C) by using the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of the angles.    So, we have:\n\n                  3 in + 2x + 4y - 5 in = 180 degrees\n\n                  Now, we can solve for x by isolating it on one side of the equation.    First, let's simplify the equation by combining like terms:\n\n                  2x + 4y = 185 degrees\n\n                  Next, let's isolate x by subtracting 4y from both sides of the equation:\n\n                  2x = 185 degrees - 4y\n\n                  Finally, let's divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:\n\n                  x = (185 degrees - 4y) / 2\n\n\n                  Now, we can substitute the value of x into the equation A + B + C = 180 degrees to find the value of C.    Since we know the length of one side (3 in) and the length of one angle (A), we can find the length of the other side (2x) and the length of the other angle (C) by using the fact that the sum of the lengths of the sides of a triangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of the angles.

Since there are four angles in a rhombus, we can divide 180 by 4 to find the measure of each angle.    We know that m \\angle Q L M = 2 x^ { 2 } - 10, so we can solve for x to find the measure of each angle.

The angle formed by the intersection of AB and the circle is called the inscribed angle. The inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. In this case, the intercepted arc is a semicircle, so its measure is 180 degrees. Therefore, the inscribed angle is 180/2 = 90 degrees. Since the inscribed angle is a right angle, it is also 90 degrees. The inscribed angle is formed by the line segment AB and the radius of the circle. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to the point where AB intersects the circle. The radius is also the length of the line segment AC, which is the length of the line segment from the center of the circle to the point where AB intersects the circle.

We can use the given information to do this.    We know that Q R = 35, R S = 37, and S Q = 12.    We also know that N L = 5.    We can use these values to find the lengths of the sides of \\triangle L M N.    Let's start with the side opposite the angle N.    We know that N L = 5, so the length of this side is 5.    Next, we can use the fact that \\triangle L M N \\sim \\triangle Q R S to find the length of the side opposite the angle M.    We know that Q R = 35, so the length of this side is 35.    Finally, we can use the fact that S Q = 12 to find the length of the side opposite the angle S.    We know that S Q = 12, so the length of this side is 12.

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees to find the value of m \\angle R.    Since the triangle is an isosceles triangle, the two angles on the left side of the triangle are equal.    Therefore, m \\angle R = (180 - 2x - 5) / 2 = (180 - 2(7) - 5) / 2 = (180 - 14 - 5) / 2 = (161) / 2 = 80.5.    So, the correct answer is C. 122.",

We can see that the x-axis is labeled with the numbers 6 and 8.    Therefore, the length of the base is 8 - 6 = 2 units.    Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is the line segment that connects the two points on the y-axis.    The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.    In this case, the hypotenuse is the line segment that connects the points (6, 8) and (8, z).    Therefore, we have:\n\n                  z^2 = (8 - 6)^2 + z^2\n\n                  Simplifying, we get:\n\n                  z^2 = 4 + z^2\n\n                  Subtracting z^2 from both sides, we get:\n\n                  0 = 4\n\n                  This is a contradiction, so there is no solution for z.

Since LM is a diameter, it is twice the radius, so LM = 2 \\* 9 = 18.    Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the line segment H P.    The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.    In this case, the hypotenuse is H P, and the other two sides are LM and H.    So, we have H P^2 = LM^2 + H^2.    Substituting the values we know, we get H P^2 = 18^2 + H^2.    Since LM = 18, we can substitute that in and get H P^2 = 324 + H^2.    Now, we can use the fact that LM = 2 \\* 9 = 18 to substitute that in and get H P^2 = 324 + (2 \\* 9)^2.
