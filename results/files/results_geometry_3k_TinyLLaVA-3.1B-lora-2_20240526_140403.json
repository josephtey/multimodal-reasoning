The diagram shows the length of the arch as 15 units. The question asks for the area of the shaded region.\n\nTo solve this problem, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Shape of the Arch**: The arch is divided into three sections by two smaller arches. This suggests that the shape of the arch is a combination of a circle and two smaller circles.\n\n2. **Calculate the Area of the Arch**: The area of the arch can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circle: \\( A = \\pi r^2 \\). The radius of the arch is half of the total length, which is 15/2 = 7.5 units. Therefore, the area of the arch is \\( A = \\pi \\times (7.5)^2 \\approx 176.71 \\).\n\n3. **Calculate the Area of the Smaller Arches**: The area of each smaller arch is half the area of the larger arch. Therefore, the area of each smaller arch is \\( \\frac{176.71}{2} \\approx 88.36 \\).\n\n4. **Calculate the Total Area of the Shaded Region**: The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the three smaller arches. Since there are two smaller arches, the total area is \\( 2 \\times 88.36 \\approx 176.72 \\).\n\n5. **Compare with the Given Choices**: The calculated area of the shaded region is 176.72. The closest choice to this value is B. 58.9.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. 58.9.",
