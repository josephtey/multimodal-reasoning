    "extracted_answer": "To find the length of the other leg \\( y \\) of a right triangle with one leg of 24 units and an angle of 30 degrees, you need to use the trigonometric function tangent (tan), which is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle.\n\nGiven:\n- One leg (opposite to the angle) = 24 units\n- Angle = 30 degrees\n\nWe have:\n\\[\n\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{y}{24}\n\\]\n\nWe know that:\n\\[\n\\tan(30^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting \\(\\tan(30^\\circ)\\) into the equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{y}{24}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( y \\):\n\\[\ny = 24 \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\\[\ny = 24 \\sqrt{3} / 3 = 24 / \\sqrt{3} = 24 \\sqrt{3}/3\n\\]\n\nSo the length of the other leg \\( y \\) is \\( 24 \\sqrt { 3 } \\).\n\nThe correct choice is C."

    "extracted_answer": "The detailed answer concludes that the correct value of \\( x \\) is 72.5\u00b0, but upon closer scrutiny, if we re-evaluate the choices listed (A. 30, B. 35, C. 70, D. 140) and the process given, it seems there might be a mistake in the interpretation. None of the choices align with 72.5\u00b0, and the problem might have an intrinsic error.\n\nHowever, based on the structured response, the solution does not match any of the available answer choices. If I were to follow the logic provided and identify the step-by-step process, the identification of a correct choice should align with \\( x = 70^\\circ \\), but this seems inconsistent given the provided steps.\n\nTherefore, based on the instruction to extract ONLY the letter, the correct response should be:\n\n**Letter Answer: C**"
